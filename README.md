# BotMother

A Telegram bot that handles your mom.

## Installation

You need a `.env` file in the root directory with the following tokens:

```
MOM_ID=
BOT_TOKEN=
MY_ID=
```

Where the `BOT_TOKEN` is the token of your bot. The `MOM_ID` is the group your mom is in, and the `MY_ID` is your personal id.
